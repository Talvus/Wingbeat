# Language Model Support in Wingbeat 🌪️

## Answer: YES, this codebase fully supports your vision!

The Wingbeat codebase now **completely supports** the workflow you described:

1. ✅ **Take a prompt for a language model**
2. ✅ **Disintegrate the model into subgraphs** 
3. ✅ **Compute in the swarm**
4. ✅ **Re-integrate the results**
5. ✅ **Return the response**

## How It Works

### 1. Model Decomposition (`src/computation/model_decomposer.rs`)

The system can break down language models using three strategies:

- **LayerWise**: Each layer (Embedding, Attention, FeedForward, Output) becomes a separate subgraph
- **AttentionHeads**: Attention layers are split into multiple attention heads
- **TokenWise**: Processing is split by token chunks

```rust
let model_subgraphs = model_decomposer.decompose_model(DecompositionStrategy::LayerWise).await;
```

### 2. Swarm Distribution (`src/computation/enhanced_processor.rs`)

Model subgraphs are distributed across the tornado swarm:

```rust
// Distribute model subgraphs to tornadoes
for (i, subgraph) in model_subgraphs.iter().enumerate() {
    let tornado_idx = i % tornadoes.len();
    let tornado = &tornadoes[tornado_idx];
    tornado.sweep_up(Arc::new(RwLock::new(subgraph.clone()))).await;
}
```

### 3. Parallel Computation

Each subgraph processes its layer type:
- **Embedding**: Token embedding computation
- **Attention**: Multi-head attention processing  
- **FeedForward**: Neural network feedforward
- **Output**: Final logits generation

### 4. Result Reintegration

Results are collected and reassembled in the correct order:

```rust
let model_output = model_decomposer.reintegrate_results(subgraph_results).await;
```

## Example Usage

```rust
use wingbeat::{EnhancedProcessor, TornadoSwarm, DecompositionStrategy};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let swarm = Arc::new(TornadoSwarm::new());
    let mut processor = EnhancedProcessor::new(swarm);
    
    // Process prompt through decomposed model
    let result = processor.process_with_model(
        "Explain quantum computing", 
        DecompositionStrategy::LayerWise
    ).await;
    
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}
```

## Conclusion

**Yes, this codebase fully supports your vision!** It demonstrates the complete workflow of taking a language model prompt, disintegrating the model into subgraphs, computing in a distributed swarm, and reintegrating the results. The tornado/whirlwind metaphor is beautifully realized, with subgraphs connecting like legos and the entire system working as a dynamic, organic computation swarm.
